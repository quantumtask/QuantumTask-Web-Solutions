Hi [Name]—

I noticed you don’t have a website yet (or it’s not active). That’s an easy win: people are searching for businesses like yours and choosing whoever looks most credible and easiest to contact.

I’m Daniel from QuantumTask.io. I build small-business sites that do one job: turn visitors into calls/WhatsApp/booking requests.

What I can deliver:

* A clean mobile-first site (1–5 pages)
* Clear services and pricing/starting-from (if you want)
* Contact/WhatsApp buttons and a simple lead form
* Google-friendly structure (so you can show up in search)

If you reply with:

1. Your business name
2. The services you want to sell
3. Your service area (city/suburb)
   …I’ll send a draft structure (and a price range) within one message.
