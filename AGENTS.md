Rules for automated edits:
- Do not redesign. Copy + section ordering only unless explicitly requested.
- Do not rename CSS classes, IDs, or change global styles.
- Do not add new frameworks or heavy dependencies.
- Prefer minimal diffs: edit the smallest number of files.
- Keep copy concise and consistent across pages.
- Before committing: run existing lint/build/test scripts. If any fail, do not commit or push.
- Always output a summary: files changed + what sections changed + guarantee metric definition used.
